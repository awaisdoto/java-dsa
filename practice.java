// we are going to be learning about graphs today

/* 
Notes: 
- Graphs are a collection of nodes and edges
- Nodes are also called vertices
- Eges are connections between nodes
- They can be uni-directional or bi-directional/undirectional
- uni-directional: one way
- bi-directional: two way
- if we connect two nodes without any arrow heads, it is bi-directional

Graphs can be represented in two ways:
- directed graph: edges have direction
- undirected graph: edges do not have direction

Edges can also have weights
- weighted graph: edges have weights (like a distance between two nodes or a cost of going from one node to another, ofcourse this is all hypothetical and they can be anything)
    They cam be positive or negative
- unweighted graph: edges do not have weights

There are 4 famous ways to create a graph:
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List
- Edge List
- 2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)

public  class main {


    // Adjacency List
/*
- It is a list of lists
we make list of edges for each node

let's try to implement it
*/

// The graph we're going to create is going to have 4 vertices and 4 edges and it's undirected and unweighted
// To store info, we'll store info about each vertex-wise, like which vertex it is connected to
// in graph terminology, each vertice we can visit is called a neighbor

// 0 -> {0,2} 0 is the source vertex and 2 is the destination vertex
// 1 -> {1,2}, {1,3}
// 2 -> {2,0}, {2,1}, {2,3}
// 3 -> {3,1}, {3,2}

// now we'll create an adjacency list for this graph
 
// we can implement adjancency list using  array of arraylist , hashpmaps 

// we'll use Array  of arraylist

// ArrayList<Edge> graph [v]
/* 
benefits of using Adjacency List: 
- No extra space is used, only space necessary for storing the edges and vertices is used
- Time is optimized, O(x) where x is the number of edges connected to a vertex 
- Adding a vertex is easy, just add a new list to the array
